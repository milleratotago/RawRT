# RawRT

Software for analyzing reaction time (RT) experiments.

To get an idea of what the software does and how to use it, I recommend working section-by-section through the script Demo0.m.  If that looks interesting, look at the other Demo*.m files.

In adddition to these files, you also need the *.m files in https://github.com/milleratotago/ExtractNameVal.git
